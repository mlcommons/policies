# MLPerf™ Results Guidelines

The MLPerf name and logo are trademarks. Any use of the MLPerf trademark must conform to these terms of use. The MLCommons organization reserves the right to solely determine if a use of its name or logo, or the MLPerf trademark, is acceptable. Any use of the benchmark results under the MLPerf trademark must conform to the guidelines in this document.

## MLPerf results must clearly identify basic details in the main text, table, or figure

Any use of results must clearly identify the following in the main text, table, or figure: submitting organization, benchmark name, version, category, division, scenario if applicable, and system under test. For example:

_SmartAI Corp achieved a score of 0.6 in closed division on the MLPerf v0.7 Image Classification benchmark using a SmartCluster submitted in available category._

For Closed Division benchmarks, the model name may be used instead of the benchmark name, e.g. "SSD" instead of "Object Detection (light-weight)".

## MLPerf results must include a detailed footnote

Any use of results of must include the following in a footnote: benchmark suite, version, and division, benchmark name and scenario if applicable, date and source of retrieval, MLPerf result ID (major-version.minor-version.entry.benchmark), and clear reference to MLPerf trademark. For example:

_[1] MLPerf v0.5 Inference Closed ResNet-v1.5 offline. Retrieved from www.mlperf.org 21 December 2018, entry 0.5-12. MLPerf name and logo are trademarks. See www.mlperf.org for more information._

## MLPerf results may only be compared against similar MLPerf results

Whether comparing official results or unverified results, comparisons must be made between results of the same benchmark and scenario from compatible versions of an MLPerf benchmark. Compatible versions are determined by the MLPerf organization. MLPerf results may not be compared against non-MLPerf results.

MLPerf Training v0.5 and v0.6 are not directly compatible and should not be compared between submitters. A given system’s v0.5 and v0.6 submissions may be compared with each other provided that the base hardware is the same and the comparisons are done with sufficient analysis to remove influence of benchmark changes such as overheads and quality targets.

## When comparing MLPerf results, you must identify any submission differences

When comparing results the main text, table, or figure must clearly identify any difference in version, division, category, official or unverified status, scenario or chipcount. 

_SmartAI Corp achieved a score of 0.6 on the MLPerf Image Classification benchmark using a SmartCluster with 8 chips in RDI category of Closed Division which is faster than the result of 7.2 achieved by LessSmartAI Corp with 16 chips in the Available on-premise category of Closed Division_

## When comparing MLPerf results of different divisions, one must identify any benchmark or dataset differences

Open division and Closed division results might not be directly compatible and should not be compared without identifying ways in which the Open result does not qualify as a Closed result. Open division and Closed division scores may be compared for a given task provided base hardware is the same. When comparing Open division and Closed division submissions on different systems, comparison should not be based on mlperf score but can be based on comparing algorithmic differences such as quality metric or samples to convergence.

Examples:

_By increasing channel count in the network architecture, SmartAI Corp achieved an accuracy of 78% on MLPerf Image Classification benchmark using a SmartCluster with 8 chips in the Open Division which is higher than the accuracy requirement of Closed Division._

_By modifying the benchmark network architecture to be more efficient, an 8 chip SmartCluster from SmartAI Corp achieved a score of 0.6 on the MLPerf Image Classification benchmark in the Open Division, which is faster than the result of 7.2 achieved on the same system in Closed Division._

## Official results must be clearly distinguished from unofficial results

You may cite either official results obtained from the MLPerf results page or unofficial results measured independently. If you cite an unofficial result you must clearly specify that the result is “Unverified” in text and clearly state “Result not verified by MLPerf” in a footnote. The result must comply with the letter and spirit of the relevant MLPerf rules.

When claiming an unofficial result, you must specify all differences in HW/SW stack to a known official submission, if one exists on a similar platform.

For example:

_SmartAI Corp announced an unverified score of 0.3 on the MLPerf Image Classification benchmark using a SmartCluster running MLFramework v4.1 [1]._

_[1] MLPerf v0.5 Training ResNet-v1.5; Result not verified by MLPerf. MLPerf name and logo are trademarks. See www.mlperf.org for more information._

Submitters are not allowed to publish any results for a given version before its official publication date. Non-submitters are not allowed to publish any unofficial results until two weeks after the official publication date for that version.

## MLPerf allows but does not endorse combining results of benchmarks

Users may see fit to combine or aggregate results from multiple MLPerf benchmark tests and/or other 3rd party results. If publicly disclosed, these composite results must cite MLPerf as required above and clearly describe the method of combination. However the composite result is not sanctioned by MLPerf and may not be represented as an official MLPerf result or score.

## Comparisons based on secondary or derived metrics must be explicit

Each MLPerf benchmark or scenario has a primary metric, for instance time-to-train for Training Image Classification, or queries/sec for the Server scenario of Inference Image Classification (Datacenter system type). Any comparison based on different or derived metric such as power rating, cost, model size/architecture, accuracy, etc. must make the basis for comparison clear in the text and in a footnote. Secondary and derived metrics must not be presented as official MLPerf metrics.

_Prestigious Research University has created a new neural network model called MagicEightBall that is 100% accurate for Top-1 image classification on the MLPerf v0.5 Training Open Division Image Classification benchmark using a cluster of 10 SmartChips running MLFramework v4.1 [1]._

_[1] Accuracy is not the primary metric of MLPerf. MLPerf name and logo are registered trademarks. See www.mlperf.org for more information._

## Violation Determination, Remedies, and Penalties

Any MLCommons member may report a violation of Result Guidelines via email to the Executive Director & WG Chairs of appropriate benchmark. ED & WG chairs would inform potential violator and request remedial action. If ED, chairs, objector, and potential violator are unable to reach a mutually satisfactory conclusion, the issue can be raised in WG to seek resolution via WG vote.

Possible remedial actions or penalties based on the degree of violation may include:
  1. Minor corrections to published materials in the form of marketing blog posts, journals, papers & other digital media
  2. If the violation was at a public event such as a conference, the committee may direct the violator to issue a public statement to correct claims in ways that conform to the guidelines
  3. The committee may issue a public statement citing the violation; suspend publication privileges or terminate license
  4. Continued failure to conform to these guidelines by a submitter may lead to marking the results as non-compliant in the results database permanently
