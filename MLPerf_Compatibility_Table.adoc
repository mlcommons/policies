N/A : Benchmark not present in a round

X: Change in benchmark. Submission results can be compared across rounds when there has been no change in the benchmark

Metric: Time-to-train (measured in minutes)

Note: v0.6 ResNet-50 v1.5, SSD-ResNet34, NMT increased accuracy targets, all v0.6 benchmarks changed initializition timing, and v0.7 MiniGo moved to 19x19 board

Metrics: Queries/second (server), Samples/second (offline),  Latency (measured in milliseconds) (single stream), Streams (multi-stream v0.5-v1.1), Latency (measured in milliseconds) (multi-stream 2.0+)

Additional power metrics: System power (measured in watts) (server and offline), system energy per stream (measured in joules) (single stream and multi-stream)

Note: Performance metrics for inference and power submissions are not comparable

Note: Multistream v0.5-v1.1 is not compatible with v2.0 and newer

Note: Inference over Network scenario introduced in v2.1

|MOSAIC 3+|N/A 3+|X
|MobileBERT 6+|X
|EDSR 5+|N/A |X
|===

Primary metrics: Latency (measured in milliseconds) (single stream), Samples/second (offline)

Note: Submission requires all benchmarks in single stream and MobileNetEdge in single stream and offline


== Tiny

|Model |0.5 |0.7 |1.0 |1.1 |1.2
|MobileNetV1 2+|X 3+|X 
|ResNet-V1 2+|X* 3+|X
|DSCNN 2+|X |X
|FC Autoencoder 2+|X 3+|X
|===

Primary metric: Latency (measured in milliseconds)

Secondary metric: Energy per inference (measured in microjoules)

*Latency Compatible, not accuracy: v0.5 and v0.7 use the same model, but changed the evaluation set to improve balance.
