Metric: Time-to-train (measured in minutes)

Note: v0.6 ResNet-50 v1.5, SSD-ResNet34, NMT increased accuracy targets, all v0.6 benchmarks changed initializition timing, and v0.7 MiniGo moved to 19x19 board

Metrics: Queries/second (server), Samples/second (offline),  Latency (measured in milliseconds) (single stream), Streams (multi-stream v0.5-v1.1), Latency (measured in milliseconds) (multi-stream 2.0+)

Additional power metrics: System power (measured in watts) (server and offline), system energy per stream (measured in joules) (single stream and multi-stream)

Note: Performance metrics for inference and power submissions are not comparable

Note: Multistream v0.5-v1.1 is not compatible with v2.0 and newer

Note: Inference over Network scenario introduced in v2.1
