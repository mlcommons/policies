|ResNet-50 v1.5 |X 6+|X 
|SSD-ResNet34 |X 4+|X 2+|N/A 
|RetinaNet-ResNeXt50 5+|N/A 2+|X

|RNN-T 3+|N/A |X 3+|X 
|3D U-Net 3+|N/A 4+|X 
|===

Metric: Time-to-train (measured in minutes)

Note: v0.6 ResNet-50 v1.5, SSD-ResNet34, NMT increased accuracy targets, all v0.6 benchmarks changed initializition timing, and v0.7 MiniGo moved to 19x19 board

== HPC

|*Model* |*0.7* |*1.0* |*2.0* 
|CosmoFlow |X |X |X 
|DeepCAM 2+|X |X 
|Open Catalyst |N/A |X |X
|===

Metrics: Time-to-train (measured in minutes) and throughput (weak scaling - measured in models/minute)

== Inference

|===
|*Model* |*0.5* |*0.7* |*1.0* |*1.1* |*2.0* |*2.1* |*3.0*
|MobileNet-v1|X 6+|N/A
|ResNet-50 v1.5 7+|X
|SSD-MobileNets 7+|X
|SSD-ResNet34 5+|X 2+|N/A 
|RetinaNet-ResNeXt50 5+|N/A 2+|X
|NMT |X 6+|N/A 
|DLRM |N/A 6+|X 
|BERT |N/A 6+|X 
|RNN-T |N/A 6+|X
|3D U-Net |N/A 6+|X
|===

Metrics: Queries/second (server), Samples/second (offline),  Latency (measured in milliseconds) (single stream), Streams (multi-stream v0.5-v1.1), Latency (measured in milliseconds) (multi-stream 2.0+)

Additional power metrics: System power (measured in watts) (server and offline), system energy per stream (measured in joules) (single stream and multi-stream)

Note: Performance metrics for inference and power submissions are not comparable

Note: Multistream v0.5-v1.1 is not compatible with v2.0 and newer

Note: Inference over Network scenario introduced in v2.1

== Mobile

|===
|*Model* |*0.7* |*1.0* |*1.1* |*2.0* 
|MobileNetEdge 4+|X
|SSD-MobileNetsV2 |X 3+|N/A 
|MobileDET |N/A 3+|X 
|MOSAIC 3+|N/A |X
|MobileBERT 4+|X 
|===

Primary metrics: Latency (measured in milliseconds) (single stream), Samples/second (offline)

Note: Submission requires all benchmarks in single stream and MobileNetEdge in single stream and offline


== Tiny

|===
|*Model* |*0.5* |*0.7* |*1.0* 
|MobileNetV1 2+|X |X
|ResNet-V1 2+|X* |X
|DSCNN 2+|X |X
|FC Autoencoder 2+|X |X
|===

Primary metric: Latency (measured in milliseconds)

Secondary metric: Energy per inference (measured in microjoules)

*Latency Compatible, not accuracy: v0.5 and v0.7 use the same model, but changed the evaluation set to improve balance.
