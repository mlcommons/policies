# General MLPerf Submission Rules v0.2

:TOC:



## Basics

These rules describe the submission, review, and publication process for all MLPerf benchmark suites. There are separate rules that govern what to submit for each MLPerf benchmark suite, including:

* https://github.com/mlperf/training_policies/blob/master/training_rules.adoc[Training Rules]

* https://github.com/mlperf/inference_policies/blob/master/inference_rules.adoc[Inference Rules]

Unless otherwise stated all rules apply to closed and open.

## Review committee

The MLPerf submission, review, and publication process is overseen by a review committee. 


### Structure

The review committee consists of the following people:



*   The chair or chairs of the following working groups:
    **   [ Inference or training, whichever is being submitted ] results
    **   [ Inference or training, whichever is being submitted ] submitters
    **   [ Inference or training, whichever is being submitted ] special topics
    **   Power
*   Until such time a permanent host organization exists:
    **   The general chair
*   When a permanent host organization exists:
    **   The executive director
    **   The chairperson of the board
*   For v0.5 only, and only for the review process: One representative of each accelerator vendor (as opposed an OEM or system vendor) who submitted and is not otherwise represented above, provide that in the opinion of the majority of the above said representative is a significant contributor to MLPerf through active participation in one or more working groups.

If representatives of a single organization, its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, or contractors hold multiple positions on this list, only one such representative is eligible to serve on the review committee. 

The review committee is chaired by the relevant results working group chair, e.g. training results working chair during a training submission review. For this reason, the results working groups may never have multiple chairs. 


### Meetings

The review committee makes decisions during properly scheduled meetings. The base meeting schedule is dictated by the review process. The review committee chair may schedule additional meetings during the review process in the course of any meeting or by emailing all committee members (e.g. mlperf-chairs mailing list) at least 24 hours in advance.

The review committee has a quorum if it includes an eligible chair and at four other eligible members.

Review committee meetings are typically held at a specific location determined by the review committee chair and in-person attendance is encouraged, but virtual attendance is to be enabled and allowed. 

Review committee meetings are open only to the review committee and all submitters in the current submission round.


### Agenda and decisions

The review committee agenda is set by, and decisions are tracked, using issues filed against the Github submission repo. In general, issues must be filed as dictated by the review process schedule. Exceptions are discouraged but may be allowed during a meeting by a vote of the review committee. In general, issues are decided in the order filed, but the chair may choose a different order if circumstances warrant.

The review committee should attempt to decide issues through discussion and grudging consensus whenever possible. However, if the review committee and all submitters are unable to reach a grudging consensus, the review committee will vote to decide the issue.

Review committee votes are determined by a majority of eligible review committee members attending a meeting. In the event of a tie, the committee chair has the casting vote. Votes are initiated by the chair, and are cast openly and may be cast verbally or using a shared spreadsheet or other voting software.

The review committee operates on balance of interests rather than by avoiding conflict of interest. Members may cast votes on all matters, including those directly affecting benchmark submissions made by their organization, as a practical response to the fact that competitors are also on the review committee.


### Confidential and not precedent setting 

Because the submission round is confidential to the submitters, the review committee agenda, deliberations, and specific decisions are confidential and shared only with committee members and submitters for that round. The general nature of decisions may be shared outside the review process because such decisions may expose the need for rules changes. 

The private submission repo will be deleted when the next MLPerf submission repo is created, or after 90 days.

Review committee decisions do not create precedents. Instead, the decisions should be explicitly incorporated into the rules through the normal process. 


## Operating principles

MLPerf’s purpose is to produce fair and useful benchmark results.

The MLPerf review committee reserves the right to amend these rules and/or exclude submissions that conflict with this purpose with a two-thirds (rounded up) vote. For instance, if the schedule is discovered to be untenable in practice, it may be amended. If a submission is judged to be deceptive or not of interest to the community, it may be excluded. 

The role of the review process is to ensure fairness of submissions, not to litigate details in an effort to disquality competitors. For example:



*   Reviewing submitters should discuss issues with owning submitters after filing objections, and attempt to resolve the issue if possible.
*   If an objection is supported by the review committee, the objecting submitter should communicate with the owning submitter to ensure a satisfactory fix. 
*   Issues in submission that are agreed to require correction, but that do not meaningfully impact performance (less than 2% cumulative performance difference) or competitive ordering may be waived by the review committee, subject to its discretion, and with the understanding that the submitter will correct the issue in future submissions.


## Schedule

MLPerf has several submission rounds each year. Each submission round follows a detailed schedule.


### Schedule of submission rounds

The submission schedule is to be set yearly, and must be approved by both the inference and training submitters meetings. The following is the remaining 2019 submission schedule.

## Submission 

The submission process defines how to submit code and results for review and eventual publication.


### Registration

Submitters must register with the submitters working group and begin attending meetings at least **eight weeks before the deadline. **In order to register, a submitter or their org must sign the relevant CLA and provide primary and secondary github handles and primary and secondary POC email address.


### Github repo

MLPerf will provide a private Github repository for submissions. Each submitter will submit one or more pull requests containing their submission to the appropriate Github repo before the submission deadline. Pull requests may be amended up until the deadline. 


### Licensing

All submissions of code must be made under the MLPerf CLA, which is temporarily the Google open source CLA. Per the CLA, all submissions of code will be Apache 2 compatible. Third party libraries need not be Apache 2 licensed.

### Verification

A submission must pass the package checker script and the result summarizer script must be capable of extracting the correct results. Specifically, the following commands must not generate errors: 

#### Training
----
python3 -m mlperf_logging.package_checker <YOUR SUBMISSION_FOLDER> training 0.7.0
python3 -m mlperf_logging.result_summarizer <YOUR SUBMISSION_FOLDER> training 0.7.0
----

#### Inference
----
# from the top of the mlperf inference repository
python3 tools/submission/submission-checker.py --input <YOUR_SUBMISSION_FOLDER> --submitter <YOUR_ORGANIZATION>
----

### Submission content

A submission must contain the following:



*   Metadata for the systems under test
*   Code that implements the benchmarks
*   Metadata that describes each system-implementation combination tested
*   Scripts that setup and execute each system-implementation tested
*   Result logs for each system-implementation tested


### Directory structure

A submission is for one code base for the benchmarks submitted. An org may make multiple submissions. A submission should take the form of a directory with the following structure. The structure must be followed regardless of the actual location of the actual code, e.g. in the MLPerf repo or an external code host site. 


#### Training

* <submitting_organization>/
** systems/
*** <system_desc_id>.json
** benchmarks/
*** <benchmark_name per reference>/ [TODO: rename the reference directories]
**** implementations/
***** <implementation_id>/
****** <arbitrary stuff>
***** <system_desc_id>/
****** <system_desc_id>_<implementation_id>.json
****** README.md
****** setup.sh (one-time configuration script)
****** init_datasets.sh (one-time dataset init script)
****** run_and_time.sh (run the benchmark and produce a result)
** results/
*** <system_desc_id>/
**** <benchmark>/
***** result_<i>.txt   # log file

System names and implementation names may be arbitrary. 

Training benchmark directory names must be one of  { **resnet, ssd, maskrcnn, transformer, gnmt, ncf, minigo **}.


#### Inference

* <submitting_organization>/
** systems/
*** <system_desc_id>.json   # combines hardware and software stack information

******** mlperf_log_summary.txt
******** mlperf_log_detail.txt
****** accuracy/
******* mlperf_log_summary.txt
******* mlperf_log_detail.txt
******* mlperf_log_accuracy.json # truncated by truncate_accuracy_log.py if too large

******** mlperf_log_accuracy.json # only necessary for TEST01
******** baseline_accuracy.txt # only for TEST01 if accuracy check fails
******** compliance_accuracy.txt # only for TEST01 if accuracy check fails
******* verify_performance.txt
******* verify_accuracy.txt # for TEST01 only


System names and implementation names may be arbitrary. 

<benchmark> must be one of {**resnet50, ssd-mobilenet, ssd-resnet34, rnnt, bert-99, bert-99.9, dlrm-99, dlrm-99.9, 3d-unet-99, 3d-unet-99.9**}. The postfix '-99' and '-99.9' indicate that the accuracy must be >= 99% or 99.9% of the target accuracy. 

<scenario> must be one of {**Offline, Server, SingleStream, MultiStream**}. 

<test_id> must be one of {**TEST01, TEST04-A, TEST04-B, TEST05**}.

Here is the list of mandatory files for all submissions in any division/category. However, your submission should still include all software information and related information for results replication. 

*   mlperf_log_summary.txt
*   mlperf_log_detail.txt
*   mlperf_log_accuracy.json
*   user.conf
*   calibration or weight transformation related code if the original MLPerf models are not used
*   actual models if the models are not deterministically generated
*   READMEs to enable users to replicate performance results
*   code which interfaces with the loadgen 
*   <system_desc_id>_<implementation_id>_<scenario>.json
*   <system_desc_id>.json
*   compliance_checker_log.txt

For some models mlperf_log_accuracy.json can get very large. Because of this we truncate mlperf_log_accuracy.log in submissions
using a tool.
A submiter will run the tool before submitting to mlperf and ***keep*** the original mlperf_log_accuracy.log files inside their organization.
The original files might be requested by mlperf during submission review so you need to store them.
Run the tool as follows, assuming <SOURCE> is your local subumission tree and <DEST> the location of the github submission repo:

```
# from top of the inference source tree
python3 tools/submission/truncate_accuracy_log.py --input <SOURCE> --output <DEST>
```

### <system_desc_id>.json metadata

|===


### Logging requirements

For Training, the results logs must be verified and stamped by the training log verification script [TODO log]. The easiest way to produce such a log is to use the 

For Inference, the results logs must have been produced by the [standard load generator](https://github.com/mlperf/inference/tree/master/loadgen). Power information may be appended using the standard power information appending script [TODO link or remove].


### Source code requirements for replication

The following section applies to all submissions in all divisions.

The source code must be sufficient to reproduce the results of the submission, given all source components specified. Any software component that would be required to substantially reproduce the submission must be uniquely identified using one of the following methods:


|===
| Software Component | Possible methods for replication | Considered “Available” for Category purposes (see later section)
| Source code or binary included in the submission repo | --- | Yes
| Depends only on public Github repo | Commit hash or tag | Yes
| Depends only on public Github repo plus one or more PRs | Commit hash or tag, and PR number(s) | Yes
| Depends only on an available binary (could be free to download or for purchase / customers only) | Name and version, or url | Yes, if the binary is a Beta or Production release
| Depends on private source code from an internal source control system | Unique source identifier [i.e., gitlab hash, p4 CL, etc] | No
| Private binary | Checksum | No
|===


### Source code requirements for inference inspection

The following section applies to all submissions in the Closed division. We encourage Open division submissions to be as transparent as possible. We will re-examine in v0.6.

For inference, the source code, pseudo-code, or prose description must be sufficient to determine:



*   The connection to the loadgen
*   Preprocessing
*   The architecture of the model, and the operations performed
*   Weights (please notify results chair if > 2 GB combined)
*   Weight transformations
**   If weight transformations are non-deterministic, then any randomness seeds used must be included in the submission.

For the inference server scenario, the source code, pseudo-code, or prose must be sufficient to determine:



*   Online batching, meaning how the server batches queries for processing


### Source code requirements for training inspection

For training, the source code must be sufficient to verify all aspects of a Closed submission including but not limited to:
* Data preprocessing
* Data traversal order
* Model 
* Model initialization
* Optimizer used
* Hyperparameters used
* Evaluation frequency
* Evaluation method

This requirement applies even to Open submissions, though the aspects do not need to match the reference.

### Compliance Testing

Submitters must run the compliance tests to verify that their submission achieves a basic level of compliance with a subset of the MLPerf rules. If compliance testing identifies a potential issue with the submission, the onus is on the submitter to provide an adequate explanation to the working group.

#### Training

This section in progress [TODO].

#### Inference

Refer to the documentation found under https://github.com/mlperf/inference/tree/master/compliance/nvidia


## Review


### Visibility of results and code during review

During the review process, only certain groups are allowed to inspect results and code. 


|===
| Group | Can Inspect
| Review committee | All results, all code
| Submitters | All results, all code
| Public | No results, no code
|===

### Required reviews

Each submitter is required to review at least one other submission. Required reviews are assigned as follows:

. Stack rank submissions by number of results.
. Assign reviewers in pairs walking down the stack rank
. If an odd number of reviewers, the bottom 3 in the stack rank will review each other.

### Auditing

TBD


### Filing objections

Submitters must officially file objections to other submitter’s code by creating a GitHub issue prior to the “Filing objections” deadline that cites the offending lines, the rules section violated, and, if pertinent, corresponding lines of the reference implementation that are not equivalent.

Each submitter must file objections with a “by <org>” tag and a “against <org>” tag. Multiple organizations may append their “by <org>” to an existing objection if desired. If an objector comes to believe the objection is in error they may remove their “by <org>” tag. All objections with no “by <org>” tags at the end of the filing deadline will be closed.

Submitters should file an objection, then discuss with the submitter to verify if the objection is correct. Following filing of an issue but before resolution, both objecting submitter and owning submitter may add comments to help the review committee understand the problem. 

If the owning submitter acknowledges the problem, they may append the “fix_required” tag and begin to fix the issue.


### Resolving objections

The review committee will review each objection, and either establish consensus or vote. If the committee votes to support an objection, it will provide some basic guidance on an acceptable fix and append the “fix_required” tag. If the committee votes against an objection, it will close the issue.


### Fixing objections

Code should be updated via a pull request prior to the “fixing objections” deadline. Following submission of all fixes, the objecting submitter should confirm that the objection has been addressed with the objector(s) and ask them to remove their “by <org> tags.

If the objector is not satisfied by the fix, then the review committee will decide the issue at its final review meeting. The review committee may vote to accept a fix and close the issue, or reject a fix and request the submission be moved to open or withdrawn. 


### Hyperparameter borrowing (training only)

Hyperparameters may be updated in accordance with the training rules prior to the final code due date.


### Withdrawing results or changing division

Anytime up until the final human readable deadline, an entry may be withdrawn by amending the pull request. Alternatively, an entry may be voluntarily moved from the closed division to the open division.


## Publication 

MLPerf will publish all results simultaneously via an update to the results page. After publication, code and results are public and free for use under the MLPerf Terms of Use.


### Results tables

There will be two results table published, one for Closed and one for Open.


### Results table content

Each results table will contain the following information: 


|===
| Field | Description
| TBD | TBD
|===


### Results categories

Results will be divided into categories based on the availability of the hardware and software components


|===
| Category | Hardware | Software
| Available in cloud | Available for rent in the cloud | Available
| Available on premise | Available for purchase | Available
| Preview | Must be available for rent or purchase in time for the next submission or within 180 days whichever is longer | Available except for software required to support substantially new hardware
| Research, Development, or Internal | Does not meet the above requirements | Does not meet the above requirements
|===


#### Available Systems

_Available_ cloud systems must (1) have available pricing (either publicly advertised or available by request), (2) have been rented by at least one third party, (3) have public evidence of availability (web page saying product is available, statement by company, etc), and (4) be “reasonably available” for rent by additional third parties by the submission date. 

An on-premise system is _Available_ if all of its components that substantially determine ML performance are _Available_ either individually or in aggregate (development boards that meet the substantially determine clause are allowed). An _Available_ component or system must (1) have available pricing (either publicly advertised or available by request), (2) have been shipped to at least one third party, (3) have public evidence of availability (web page saying product is available, statement by company, etc), and (4) be “reasonably available” for purchase by additional third parties by the submission date.  In addition, submissions for on-premise systems must describe the system and its components in sufficient detail to enable third parties to build a similar system. 

In both cases, “reasonably available” means:



1. Supply and lead times are appropriate for system scale, i.e. on-demand and in quantity for the smallest systems and a few months and with limited supply for the largest systems.
2. Access to rent or purchase may be subject to conditions that are common to generally available products (such as financial qualifications, size of customer, support burden, export restrictions, etc.) but is not otherwise restricted (i.e. no “early access” approval requirements).

However, it is allowed for the qualifying pre-submission rentals/purchases to have been made with restrictions such as “early access” approval.

_Available_ systems must use an _Available_ software stack. A software stack consists of the set of software components that substantially determine ML performance but are not in the uploaded source code. For instance, for training this includes at a minimum any required ML framework (e.g. TensorFlow, pyTorch) and ML accelerator library (e.g. cuDNN, MKL). An _Available_ software stack consists of only _Available_ software components.

An Available software component must be well supported for general use. For open source software, you must base the software on any commit in an "official" repo plus a PR to support a particular architecture. For binaries, the binary must be made available as release, or as a "beta" release with the requirement that optimizations will be included in a future "official" release. The beta must be made available to customers as a clear part of the release sequence. The software must be available at the time of submission.


#### Preview Systems

A _Preview_ system is a system which will meet the requirements of an _Available_ system within 180 days of the submission date, or by the next MLPerf submission date, whichever is more, and which the submitter commits to submitting as an _Available_ system by that time. If it is not submitted in that submission round with equal or better performance (allowing for noise), the _Preview_ submission will be marked as invalid. Systems are exempt from this requirement if the submitted benchmarks are retired or changed to such a degree as no longer reasonably runnable on that system.

 

If a _Preview_ system contains a newly developed hardware component (e.g. a new ML accelerator) that is a substantial contributor to the determination of ML performance, then for that submission only, the “Available software stack” requirement is waived for software that is necessary to support that component. Otherwise, _Preview_ systems must meet the same _Available_ software stack requirements as an _Available_ system. For example, the first shipping version of a new accelerator need not meet the _Available _software stack requirements, but subsequent SKUs of that accelerator are not considered newly developed, and must meet _Available_ software stack requirements.


#### Research, Development, or Internal Systems

A research, development, or internal (RDI) component  does not meet the requirements for an available or preview component. An RDI system is a system containing one or more RDI components. The RDI components may not be submitted as _Available_ components  until the submission cycle after next or 181 days whichever is longer


## After publication


### Terms of use

Any use of published results in connection with the MLPerf trademark must follow the [terms of use.](https://github.com/mlperf/policies/blob/master/TERMS%20OF%20USE.md)


### Issues discovered after publication

#### Scenario
Results posted on mlperf.org have been generated from a non-compliant submission, and the fix results in >5% cumulative reduction in performance.

#### Process flow
Any MLCommons member may raise an objection to any published results via email to any MLCommons WG chair. An objection review committee (minimally four MLPerf chairs) will screen the objection. If rejected at this stage, the committee chair will respond to the objector with the reasoning.

Otherwise, the committee will designate an investigator with no conflict of interest to produce a brief (e.g. 1 page) report confidential to the committee, which will include a response from the submitter of the disputed result. Based on the report, the committee will respond to the objector or start further investigation on a case-by-case basis.

#### Possible investigation outcomes
1. The objection is not valid.
2. The result-in-question is moved to open for noncompliance with the rules.
3. The result-in-question is removed due to intentional cheating.
